## Suggested Improvements and Safe Checks

1. Check hard-coded file paths and change to configurable paths (use argparse or config file).
2. Avoid storing secret keys in repository; use environment variables.
3. Add requirements.txt listing external packages (if any).
4. Add unit tests for hashing and verification functions.
5. Add logging instead of print statements; configure logging level.
6. If the app opens network ports, mention security and binding to localhost.
7. Consider packaging with a setup.py or using Docker for reproducible runs.

### Quick code notes (from scanning files)

- app.py: contains the words 'secret' or 'key' — review for embedded keys.
- app.py: may expose a network service — ensure you're aware of host/port binding.
- app.py: uses environment variables (good).
- review3.py: contains the words 'secret' or 'key' — review for embedded keys.
- review3.py: references baseline/hash files — ensure these files are not committed.
